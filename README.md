# EEWatchface
a custom WatchFace for my garmin smartwatch


# TODO
- detect sleep state
- complete own font
- support buffered drawing
- general caching of slow changing values
- add atmospheric pressure value (maybe?)

# done
- detect bluetooth on but not connected (no support by the api)
- buffer values and drawing of quadwidet (not worth it)
- color heartbeat according to heartbeat range sections (done)
- cycling widget -> show only stats of current month (done -> buggy activity time :-()
